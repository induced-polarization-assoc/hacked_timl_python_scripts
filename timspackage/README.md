# `timspackage` Documentation:
Basically this is where the old code goes to get modified before it is put out of its digital, proverbial
misery. 

These will be modified to use other subpackage modules to handle things like file IO, plotting, and 
user interfacing. 

After I get some logs generated from this, the next task is to get the other subpackages populated
with their assorted functions and classes so that we can pivot over to using those.

NOTE: 

THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL PYTHON SCRIPTS THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED AND MODDED SO THEY PLACE NICELY
ON OTHER PEOPLES' MACHINES. FOR THE TIME BEING THIS IS WHERE THE MODIFICATIONS WILL LIVE. 

WHEN THEY ARE READY TO BE DEPLOYED INTO THE WILD, THEY WILL BE RELOCATED SAFELY UP INTO THE SUBPACKAGES
THEY CORRESPOND TO!!!
